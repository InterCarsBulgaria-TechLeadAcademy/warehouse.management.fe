# Warehouse management FE

### Running the project

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

**You can also use `pnpm` or `yarn`. I just can't use it because I'm working with WSL and it's not working properly, so make sure you add .lock file**

# Please read [this](https://profy.dev/article/react-architecture-api-layer#refactoring-to-a-separate-api-layer) when API has done some actual endpoints and try to impement it
